\title{Percentage of all non-overlapping data}
\description{
The \code{pand} function calculates the percentage of all non-overlapping data (PAND; Parker, Hagan-Burke, & Vannest, 2007), an index to quantify a level increase (or decrease) in performance after the onset of an intervention.
}

\usage{
pand(data, decreasing = FALSE, correction = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{data}{A single-case data frame or a list of single-case data frames. See \code{\link{makeSCDF}} to learn about this format.}
  \item{decreasing}{If you expect data to be lower in the B phase, set \code{decreasing = TRUE}. Default is \code{decreasing = FALSE}.}
  \item{correction}{The default \code{correction = TRUE} makes \code{pand} use a frequency matrix, which is corrected for ties. A tie is counted as the half of a measurement in both phases. Set \code{correction = FALSE} to use the uncorrected matrix, which is not recommended.}
}

\value{
  \item{PAND}{Percentage of all non-overlapping data.}
  \item{phi}{Effect size Phi based on expected and observed values.}
  \item{POD}{Percentage of overlapping data points.}
  \item{OD}{Number of overlapping data points.}
  \item{n}{Number of data points.}
  \item{N}{Number of cases.}
  \item{nA}{Number of data points in phase A.}
  \item{nB}{Number of data points in phase B.}
  \item{pA}{Percentage of data points in phase A.}
  \item{pB}{Percentage of data points in phase B.}
  \item{matrix}{2x2 frequency matrix of phase A and B comparisons.}
  \item{matrix.counts}{2x2 counts matrix of phase A and B comparisons.}
  \item{correlation}{A list of the \code{correlation} values: statistic, parameter, p.value, estimate, null.value, alternative, method, data.name, correction.}
  \item{correction}{Logical argument from function call (see \code{Arguments} above).}
}

\details{
The PAND indicates nonoverlap between phase A and B data (like \code{PND}), but uses all data and is therefore not based on one single (probably unrepresentative) datapoint.  Furthermore, PAND allows the comparison of real and expected associations (Chi-square test) and estimation of the effect size Phi, which equals Pearsons r for dichotomous data.  Thus, phi-Square is the amount of explained variance.  The original procedure for computing the PAND (Parker, Hagan-Burke, & Vannest, 2007) does not account for ambivalent datapoints (ties).  The newer \code{NAP} overcomes this problem and has better precision-power (Parker, Vannest, & Davis, 2014).
